$$\rho(\tilde{\nu}, \hat{\Omega}_i, \hat{\Omega}_r) = \frac{L_r(\tilde{\nu}, \hat{\Omega}_r, \hat{\Omega}_i)}{L_i(\tilde{\nu}, \hat{\Omega}_i) \cos(\Omega_i,\hat{n}) d\Omega_i}$$

Here, $L_r(\tilde{\nu}, \hat{\Omega}_r, \hat{\Omega}_i)$ represents the spectral radiance scattered into the direction $\hat{\Omega}_r$ from the direction $\hat{\Omega}_i$, and $L_i(\tilde{\nu}, \hat{\Omega}_i)$ represents the incident infinitesimal spectral irradiance (from direction $\hat{\Omega}_i$). In the denominator, $\cos(\Omega_i,\hat{n})$ is a projected area factor — $\hat{n}$ is the unit vector normal to the surface —   accounting for the fall-off of available scattering surface area as the incident beam diverges from normal incidence.
